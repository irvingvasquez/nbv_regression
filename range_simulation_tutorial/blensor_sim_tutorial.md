# Range Simulation with Blensor

There are several ways to simulate a range sensor. In this tutorial I will use blensor. Blensor is mounted over Blender an privides very realistic simulations with just a few configurations. Below I will describe its advantages and disadvantages against a real time simulator as Gazebo.

### Blensor advantages

- Fast and easy installation and configuration.
- Called from a simple python script.
- Accurate simulation.
- Includes noisy sensors.
- Fast scene configurations.

### Blensor disadvantages

- No real time simulation
- Non dinamic scenarios
- No mechanic positioning system
- No integration with ROS

## Blensor Instalation

The best way to install blensor is to follow the official documentation.
